Ever forgotten to take care of your leafy friends? Introducing Bloomi, your virtual garden and plant tracking app!  

## Key Features
- Bloomi is your portable garden, containing all your plants and delivers periodic reminders to care for them.  
- The app allows you to keep track of all your plants as well as their growth overtime, and generates a graph to provide a visual of its progress.  
- By enabling Watering Notifications, you are notified on a date, time and frequency of your choice to care for your plants.
