## Features
Bloomi is your portable garden, containing all your plants and delivers periodic reminders to care for them.  
The app allows you to keep track of all your plants as well as their growth overtime, and generates a graph to provide a visual of its progress.  
By enabling Watering Notifications, you are notified on a date, time and frequency of your choice to care for your plants.
